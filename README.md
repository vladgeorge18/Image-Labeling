# Image Labelling

In this project, we tackle the task of image labeling, essential for applications like image 
search engines and object recognition in computer vision. Our approach combines two 
methods: K-means for color classification and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) for shape 
classification. 
Our tool is able to return images given a query like: name of the color (ex:Pink), name of the cloth
(ex: Jeans, Dress), name of the cloth plus color (ex: Black Dress). A percentage for each category 
can be specified for more precision
